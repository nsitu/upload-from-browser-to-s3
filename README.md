# upload-from-browser-to-s3
I needed to upload videos to Amazon S3 from the browser. I found that [Sam Meech](https://github.com/Sam-Meech-Ward/s3-direct-upload) already had a good solution. I have adapted it here to fit my own needs. See also, Sam's [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGYeYJpRWPM) on the subject.
